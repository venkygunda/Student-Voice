# Student-voice
Our project “Student’s Voice” is a web-application which is a platform between students and college administration/organization to raise grievance which has been overcome by the student. The tools used in this project are HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) along with JavaScript as the front-end tools. Nodejs, Express is used for the back-end tools. MySQL is used to store login details and record the queries. By implementing the login details, student’s authentication can be possible. The main aim of this project is to send the complaint to the concerned faculty anonymously. For messaging the queries, we are using Twilio API.
